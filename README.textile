h2. Installing rails_rrdtool

cd vendor/plugins && git clone git://github.com/bluescripts/rails_rrdtool.git rails_rrdtool


h2. Creating a RRD

RRD.create(path,params)

example usage:
<pre>
<code>
 RRD.create('/test.rrd', {:step => 300, :heartbeat => 600, :ds => [  {:name => "test", :type => "GAUGE"}, {:name => "josh", :type => "GAUGE"} ]  , :xff => ".5", :rra => [ {:type => "max", :steps => 20, :rows => 1} ] })
</code>
</pre>

first value is a path to the rrd db, the 2nd param is a hash of keys and values

:ds is an array containing hashes for each DataSource (DS) type in the db

:xff is the x files factor (see RRD website for more info on this), range is acceptable between 0 and 1

:rra is a array containing hashes with RRA types and corresponding values

h2. Updating a RRD

RRD.update(path,params)

<pre>
<code>
 RD.update('/test/path.rrd', ["123", "456", 1234])
</code>
</pre>

# example usage:
    # RRD.update('/test/path.rrd', ["123", "456a", 1234])
    # first param is path to rrd db
    # 2nd param will return data string of 123:456:1234 (each value is sanitized, only numeric values accepted)
    # to be passed as the data values to be passed to the db
    # N specifies the current time (NOW)
