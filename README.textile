h2. Creating a RRD

RRD.create(path,params)

example usage:
<pre>
<code>
 RRD.create('/test.rrd', {:step => 300, :heartbeat => 600, :ds => [  {:name => "test", :type => "GAUGE"}, {:name => "josh", :type => "GAUGE"} ]  , :xff => ".5", :rra => [ {:type => "max", :steps => 20, :rows => 1} ] })
</code>
</pre>

    first value is a path to the rrd db, the 2nd param is a hash of keys and values
    :ds is an array containing hashes for each DataSource (DS) type in the db
    :xff is the x files factor (see RRD website for more info on this), range is acceptable between 0 and 1
    :rra is a array containing hashes with RRA types and corresponding values
